Model 2 (VGG16 with Data Augmentation):

Utilizes the VGG16 architecture with repeated 3x3 convolutional layers.
Data augmentation applied during training to improve generalization.
Deeper architecture compared to the basic CNN, potentially capturing more complex patterns.


Training and Validation:
--------------------------

Model 1 (Basic CNN):

Uses basic data augmentation through ImageDataGenerator.
